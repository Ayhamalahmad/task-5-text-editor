## How It Works

The editor uses the `execCommand` method to apply text formatting and other commands to the selected text within the contenteditable element. JavaScript is used to manage button clicks and execute the appropriate `execCommand` based on the user's actions.

Please note that `execCommand` is now considered deprecated and has limitations in modern browsers. It is recommended to explore alternative methods and libraries for rich text editing.

Deprecated: This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the compatibility table at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.
